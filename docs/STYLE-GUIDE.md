# Mementos App Style Guide

Hi there wonderful contributors.

We're happy to say, that we opted to use popular community supported* style guides instead of coming up with our own. In this particular case, we're going to use John Papa's 'AngularJS Style Guide' and the 'Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide()'.

We've copied these style guides into our project for easy reference with only a very few minor changes. However, there are a few points in which the style guides contradict themselves. For this reason, always prioritize the AngularJS style guide when you find a point of contradiction between the styles.

It's a lot to read, but we promise that they're totally worth it. And there's a really high chance that you'll learn a thing or two when reading them.

*John Papa's style guide is very opinionated, but he's open to suggestions.
